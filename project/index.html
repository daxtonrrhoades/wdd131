                <h3>Prequels</h3>
                <p>Two Jedi Knights, Qui Gon Jinn, and Obi Wan Kenobi, are sent to negotiate with the Trade Federation.

                <p>While there they are attacked by Separatist droids and have to battle their way out.</p>
                <p>They end up making their way to Tattooine and discover a young junnkyard slave, Anakin Skywalker, who
                    they
                    believe could be the Chosen One.</p>
                <p>Qui Gon Jinn is killed by Darth Maul and Obi Wan must train the young boy.</p>
                <p>In the next film, 10 years later, Anakin is a grown Jedi Knight and training under Obi Wan as his
                    padawan.
                </p>
                <p>The Jedi obtain a clone army who are clones of a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. The Separatists make
                    moves
                    and begin the Clone Wars.</p>
                <p>In the third and final film of the prequels, Anakin forms a friendly bond with Chancellor Palpatine.
                </p>
                <p>When Anakin is asked to spy on the Chancellor, he is filled with anger and is drawn to the dark side.
                </p>
                <p>Obi Wan and Anakin battle on the lava planet of Mustafar where Padme follows and has birth to twins
                    shortly
                    before passing away.</p>
