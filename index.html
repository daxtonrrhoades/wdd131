                <p>Hello there! I am Daxton Rhoades. I am a student at BYU Pathway Worldwide working towards a degree in
                    software development, and I currently work full time at Americ First Credit Union in Draper, Utah. I
                    was
                    born and raised in Sandy, Utah and have been here my whole life along with a brother, two sisters,
                    and
                    my lovely parents. Some things I enjoy doing are playing video games, basketball, skateboarding, and
                    painting. My favorite movies are the Star Wars movies and I am obsessed with them.</p>
